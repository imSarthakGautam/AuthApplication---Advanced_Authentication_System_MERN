Sure! Let’s break down the logic of how the input fields work and how pressing keys is handled, in simple terms.

### 1. **Understanding the Inputs**
   - There are six input boxes on the screen, each meant for one digit of the verification code.
   - These six boxes together will hold the entire code, like this: `[1][2][3][4][5][6]`.

### 2. **Typing in the Boxes (handleChange)**

The `handleChange` function is called when the user types into any of the six code input boxes.

1. **Typing Single Characters**:
   - When you type a single character in an input box, that character gets saved in the `code` array at the position of the input box.
   - After you type, the focus (the blinking cursor) automatically moves to the next input box, so you can type the next digit right away.

2. **Pasting Multiple Characters**:
   - If you paste a code (like "123456"), `handleChange` will take each digit and place it into its own input box.
   - The function takes the first six characters from what you pasted, splits them, and fills them across all six input boxes.
   - Then, it moves the focus to the first empty input box or keeps it at the last box if all are filled.

### `handleKeyDown` - For Backspace

The `handleKeyDown` function is called when you press a key while in an input box.

1. **Using Backspace**:
   - When you press "Backspace" in an input box and it’s already empty, this function automatically moves you back to the previous input box. This way, you can quickly delete the previous digit without having to manually click on that input box.

### Summary

- **Typing** moves you forward to the next box.
- **Pasting** fills all the boxes at once.
- **Backspace** moves you back to the previous box if the current one is empty.

This makes entering or fixing the code super quick and easy!
