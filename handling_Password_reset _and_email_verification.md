These fields are commonly used in a user schema to handle password resets and email verification. Here’s what each field does:

1. **`resetPasswordToken: String`**
   - Stores a token (usually a random string) that is generated when a user requests to reset their password. This token is used to verify the user when they attempt to reset their password.
   - Typically, this token is sent to the user's email, allowing them to use it as a link for password resetting.

2. **`resetPasswordExpiresAt: Date`**
   - Stores the expiration time of the `resetPasswordToken`. This ensures that the password reset token is only valid for a specific time period (e.g., 1 hour).
   - If the user tries to reset their password after this time, the token will be considered expired, and they will need to request a new one.

3. **`verificationToken: String`**
   - Stores a token (again, often a random string) generated when a user registers or needs to verify their email.
   - This token is typically sent to the user’s email address as part of an account verification link. When the user clicks the link, the system uses this token to verify the user’s identity.

4. **`verificationTokenExpiresAt: Date`**
   - Stores the expiration time for the `verificationToken`, making sure the verification link is only valid for a set period.
   - If the user doesn’t verify their email within this timeframe, the token will expire, and they may need to request a new verification link.

### Example Usage in a Password Reset Flow
1. When the user requests a password reset, the system generates a unique `resetPasswordToken` and sets `resetPasswordExpiresAt` to a time in the future (e.g., 1 hour later).
2. An email is sent to the user with a link containing the token.
3. When the user clicks the link, the system checks if the token is still valid by comparing the current time to `resetPasswordExpiresAt`.
4. If valid, the user can reset their password. If expired, they need to request a new token.

### Example Usage in an Email Verification Flow
1. Upon registration, a `verificationToken` is created and `verificationTokenExpiresAt` is set.
2. An email is sent to the user with a link containing the token.
3. When the user clicks the link, the system verifies the token and, if valid and not expired, marks the user as verified.

These fields add security and ensure that tokens are only usable within specified timeframes, preventing old or unused tokens from being exploited.
